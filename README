To run the parser use the following commands : 
1) cd asgn3
2) make
3) bin/parser test/test1.scala (to execute the first test-case file test1.c)
4) firefox output.html
If the 3rd command gives an error of list index out of range it means that the given code is wrong and the testcase is not parseable
To check the error run the following command 

python bin/parsermain.py test/test1.scala

The output will be on terminal
